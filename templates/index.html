            Neonicotinoids are the most widely used insecticide. These insecticides work by targeting and disrupting neurological pathways.
            Studies done thus far exploring the effects of neonicotinoids have found that they can move within an ecosystem.
            Once plants are treated, the insecticide can transfer to pollinators and to pests, which can affect the food webs on a greater scale.
            The advantage of using neonicotinoids is their ability to be applied to plants and remain effective for up to 3 years, due to their use of the plant's vascular system.
            Once applied, target pest insects die immediately from exposure. In addition, many nontarget species are exposed to neonicotinoids and ingest the pesticide at sublethal levels.
            This in turn can lead to the exposure of neonicotinoids to other consumers, and travel up a food web.
            Many studies have demonstrated the mortality of vertebrates, such as birds, as a result of exposure to neonicotinoids.
            Additionally, it has been found that exposure can disrupt species-specific phenology, including breeding and migration.
            The Audubon Society of Rhode Island and URI's Water for the World Lab seek to establish a monitoring program across its wildlife refuges to understand the capacity of these chemicals to infiltrate conservation land where
            negative impacts to biota can undermine the potential of these areas to serve as refugia for birds, pollinating insects, and other species.
            Below you will find tables and graphs depicting neonicotinoid concentrations across different sampling sites. This data helps track contamination trends over time.
